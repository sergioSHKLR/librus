# 🏠 Home

Inspired by other initiatives of digital education & communication, we created this platform which combines dispersed sources & tools providing the user with a first-of-its-kind integrated knowledge platform. 

Our interface is composed of three columns which are selectively displayed according to the width of the device used. This way you'll see three columns in large screens, two in medium screens, and only one on small screens.

The split-layout allows for the reading & highlighting (Hypothes.is annotator) of the main content while also viewing of complementary material (articles, word definitions, maps, videos, audio, video-calls, etc) without wrangling separate tabs or windows. Also, it minimizes distraction and increases topic rentention & recall.

Read the <kbd>📋 Info</kbd> page to familiarize with the standards utilized in our project.

🙏🏼 So be it!
