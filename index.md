**Loosely Integrated Book Reading Unified System (LIBRUS)**

## Inspiration

Inspired by other initiatives of self and [distance education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_education){:target="ext"}, we created this platform which combines dispersed sources & tools providing the user with a first-of-its-kind integrated knowledge platform. 

## Usage

While designed for a group setting (i.e. book clubs, bible study, etc) it can also be used by individuals on a self-paced course.

Read the 📋 [Info](./2-info.md) page to familiarize with the standards utilized in our project.

## Main interface

Our interface is composed of three columns which are selectively displayed according to the width of the device used. This way you'll see three columns in large screens, two in medium screens, and only one on small screens.

The split-layout allows for the reading & [highlighting](https://web.hypothes.is/everyone/){:target="ext"} of the main content while also viewing of complementary material (articles, word definitions, maps, videos, audio, video-calls, etc) without wrangling separate tabs or windows. Also, it minimizes distraction and increases topic rentention & recall.

## Reader enhancements

Additionally, we have been able to implement a few of the text adjustments usually restricted to eBook readers. While in a book, click the three dots menu to view options.

## License

While adhering to our Creative Commons license, feel free to use, translate, modify, and improve it.
